Research in the lab is organized into two main strands of activity: 

- Dr Srdan Medimorec leads a strand of work on Language, Learning and Memory.

- Dr Christopher Wilson leads a strand of work on decision-making with specific interest in economic decision-making and gambling behaviour.

The work is conducted through a series of interrelated projects that align with these research strands. 

The studies we conduct in the lab are usually experimental in nature, often involving behavioural tasks completed on a computer. We employ psychophysiological measures such as eye-tracking and neuroimaging (fNIRS) to gain insights into cognitive processes underlying task performance. 

We also conduct experiments or questionnaire-based studies online.
