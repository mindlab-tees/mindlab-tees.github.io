    "section": "Some of our training sessions",
    "text": "Some of our training sessions\nThese are some of the core skills for conducting research in the MIND lab. While other sessions might be more specific to a particular project, these sessions are designed to provide a solid foundation for all students in the lab.\n\nIntroduction to functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) for brain imaging\n\nThis workshop will provide an introduction to Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS), a non-invasive neuroimaging technique that measures brain activity by detecting changes in blood oxygenation. fNIRS is based on the principle that when a brain region is activated, blood flow to that region increases, leading to an increase in oxygenated hemoglobin and a decrease in deoxygenated hemoglobin. fNIRS uses near-infrared light to measure these changes in blood oxygenation, allowing researchers to study brain function in real-time.\n\n\nIntroduction to eye-tracking for cognitive psychology\n\nEye-tracking is a powerful tool for studying visual attention and cognitive processes in cognitive psychology. It allows researchers to measure where and how long participants look at different stimuli, providing insights into their cognitive processes. Eye-tracking can be used to study a wide range of topics, including visual perception, attention, memory, and decision-making.\nIn this session, we will cover the basics of eye-tracking, including how eye-trackers work, how to set up an eye-tracking experiment, and how to analyze eye-tracking data. We will also discuss some common applications of eye-tracking in cognitive psychology research.\n\n\nDesigning and coding experiments with OpenSesame\n\nOpenSesame is a free and open-source software package for designing and running psychological experiments. It is designed to be user-friendly and flexible, allowing researchers to create a wide range of experimental paradigms without needing extensive programming knowledge. OpenSesame supports various types of stimuli, including images, sounds, and videos, and can be used to collect data from participants in both laboratory and online settings. It can also interface with various hardware devices, such as eye trackers and response boxes, making it a versatile tool for researchers in cognitive psychology and neuroscience.\nIn this workshop, we will cover the basics of designing and coding experiments with OpenSesame, including how to create a simple experiment, how to use different types of stimuli, and how to collect and analyse data.\n\n\nIntroduction to data analysis with R\n\nR is a free and open-source programming language and software environment for statistical computing and graphics. It is widely used in the fields of data analysis, statistics, and machine learning, making it a valuable tool for researchers in cognitive psychology and neuroscience.\nIn the MIND lab, R is our default tool for analysis and visualisation of data. In this workshop, we will cover the basics of R, including how to install and set up R and RStudio, how to import and manipulate data. We will also cover some common statistical techniques used in cognitive psychology and neuroscience research, such as t-tests, ANOVA, and regression analysis.\n\n\nIntroduction to Zotero for reference management\n\nZotero is a free and open-source reference management software that helps researchers collect, organize, and cite their references. It is designed to be user-friendly and flexible, allowing researchers to create a personal library of references and easily generate citations in various styles. Zotero can automatically extract metadata from web pages, PDFs, and other sources, making it easy to add references to your library.\nIn this workshop, we will cover the basics of using Zotero for reference management, including how to install and set up Zotero, how to add references to your library, and how to generate citations in different styles. We will also discuss some best practices for using Zotero to promote transparency and reproducibility in research.\n\n\nUsing OpenScience Framework (OSF) for research management\n\nThe Open Science Framework (OSF) is a free and open-source web-based platform for managing and sharing research projects. It is designed to help researchers organize their work, collaborate with others, and share their findings with the broader scientific community. OSF provides a range of tools for managing research projects, including file storage, version control, and project management features.\nWe will cover the basics of using OSF for research management, pre-registration, and sharing research findings. We will also discuss best practices for using OSF to promote transparency and reproducibility in research.\n\n\nUsing GitHub for version control and collaboration\n\nGitHub is a web-based platform for version control and collaboration that is widely used in the fields of software development and data science. It allows researchers to track changes to their code and data, collaborate with others, and share their work with the broader scientific community.\nWhen coding cognitive psychology and neuroscience experiments, it is important to keep track of changes to the code and data, especially when working in a team. GitHub provides a range of tools for version control, including branching, merging, and pull requests, making it easy to collaborate with others and keep track of changes to the code. In this session, we will cover the basics of using GitHub for version control and collaboration, including how to create a repository, how to commit changes, and how to collaborate with others using pull requests. We will also discuss best practices for using GitHub to promote transparency and reproducibility in research.\n\n\nIntroduction to JSPsych for coding online experimental tasks\n\nJSPsych is a JavaScript library for creating and running online psychological experiments. It is designed to be flexible and easy to use, allowing researchers to create a wide range of experimental paradigms that can be run in web browsers.\nLike OpenSesame, JSPsych supports various types of stimuli, including images, sounds, and videos, and can be used to collect data from participants in both laboratory and online settings.\nJSPsych is particularly useful for researchers who want to run experiments online, due to its ability to collect data from participants in real-time and its compatibility with various web-based platforms. However, it requires programming knowledge, as it is based on JavaScript and HTML.\nIn this workshop, we will cover the basics of using JSPsych for coding online experimental tasks, including how to create a simple experiment, how to use different types of stimuli, and how to collect and analyze data. We will also discuss some common applications of JSPsych in cognitive psychology and neuroscience research.\n\n\nMixed effects modelling with R\nMixed effects modelling is a powerful statistical technique used to analyze data with complex hierarchical structures, such as repeated measures or nested data. It allows researchers to account for both fixed and random effects in their models, making it a valuable tool for analyzing data in cognitive psychology and neuroscience research.\nIn this workshop, we will cover the basics of mixed effects modelling with R, including how to fit mixed effects models using the lme4 package, how to interpret the results, and how to visualize the results using the ggplot2 package. We will also discuss some common applications of mixed effects modelling in cognitive psychology and neuroscience research."

I am undertaking a research projectand I would like to invite you to take part. Before you decide if you want to please read the following information and discuss it with others if you wish. Please contact me if you have any questions: Dr. Christopher Wilson (christopher.wilson at tees dot ac dot uk?subject=Research%20Participation%20Query)\nWhat is the purpose of the study?\nThis study aims to understand the relationship between engagement with sports and gambling behaviour.\nWhy am I being invited to take part?\nYou have been invited because I believe you are a member of a sports club or a person who regularly follows watches sports.\nTo be able to take part though you must be:\n\nat least 18 years old\nare a member of a sports club or a person who regularly follows watches sports\n\nDo I have to take part?\nNo, it’s up to you if you want to, or not.\nWhat would I be asked to do if I chose to take part?\nComplete several questionnaires which cover the following topics:\n\nDemographics (i.e., your age, gender, education level and income)\nYour engagement with sports and socialisation with sports groups\nYour current and prior experiences of gambling\n\nWhat are the possible disadvantages, or risks, of taking part?\nWe do not anticipate any specific risks. However, if you feel uncomfortable answering questionnaires that cover any of the above topics, such as gambling, then you do not have to take part. You can also choose to withdraw your participation at any time during the study.\nWhat are the possible benefits to taking part?\nWe hope to gain a better understanding of the links between sports participation and gambling behaviour. In the future, we believe this could lead to more targeted support for those who suffer from gambling harms.\nWhat would happen to the information collected about me?\nThe responses to the questions that you provide will initially be stored in an encrypted form on a web server, and then downloaded to Teesside University storage, managed by the principal investigator and accessible by the researchers named on this form.\nThis information will be identified only by a randomly-generated participant ID code, so will be anonymised from the outset. The responses you provide (in anonymised form) will be retained indefinitely, and used for the purposes of research, which will include publication of data in reports, research articles and in data repositories such as the open science framework (OSF).\nIf you wish to receive a token of compensation for taking part in this study (£5 shopping voucher), you will be asked to provide your email address so that the e-voucher can be emailed to you from the voucher provider. You can choose not to do this, but if you provide your email address, it will be stored separately from your questionnaire responses, to preserve your anonymity.

    "text": "A new paper from the MIND Lab has been published in the journal Behavioural Brain Research. The paper, titled “Neurological and behavioural correlates of construal in economic decision-making under cognitive load”, examines how construal level interacts with cognitive load, numeracy, financial literacy and self-control during economic decision-making.\nThis paper has relevance to our understanding of gambling behaviour, as the decisions under examination were functionally gambling decisions. The findings suggest that high construal (thinking about the big picture) promotes risk aversion under cognitive load, while low construal (focusing on details) may lead to increased risk-taking. Additionally, individual differences in self-control, financial literacy and subjective numeracy were found to influence brain activation patterns during these decisions.\nThe study employed functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to measure brain activity, specifically in the lateral pre-frontal cortex (LPFC), which is associated with decision-making and self-control. The results provide new insights into how cognitive processes and individual differences interact to influence economic decisions, particularly in contexts that resemble gambling.\nThe full paper can be accessed via the following link: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbr.2025.115829"

    "text": "The MIND Lab has been awarded a grant by the Academic Forum for the Study of Gambling (AFSG) to explore how social identification with sports groups predicts gambling behaviour. In addition, the research will examine the normalisation of gambling within certain sports groups and develop recommendations for stakeholders on their approaches to gambling harm reduction.\n\n\nHighlighting the links between sport and gambling in the UK, Dr. Christopher Wilson discussed his project with the AFSG:\n\n“The increasing prominence of gambling in professional sports broadcasting and sponsorship creates an association between them, to the extent that gambling is starting to become a normalised part of socialising around some sports. It’s important that we understand which features of gambling behaviour are predicted by this relationship, and how sports groups experience the exposure to gambling, so we can provide evidence to support targeted harm-reduction approaches.”\n\nThe project is led by Dr. Christopher Wilson and Co-investigators Dr. Srdan Medimorec, Dr. Robert Portman, Dr. Judith Eberhardt. Hannah Poulter (Bristol) is also collaborating on this project. Project updates will be shared on the MIND Lab website and media channels, so please follow us to keep up to date with our research.\n\nDetails are available on the AFSG website."

Being a member of the lab is an active process and we expect all members to contribute to the lab in a meaningful way.\nSome expectations apply to all lab members regardless of their role, while others are specific to certain roles.\n\nAll lab members\nEveryone can conduct research that they are interested in and passionate about. We will do so in a way that is ethical and responsible, we will be transparent about our methods and findings and we will adhere to Teesside University regulations at all times.\nEveryone can learn from each other. This means that everyone will be expected to participate in lab meetings and discussions, presenting their work and providing feedback to others.\nEveryone can become skilled a researcher. This lab conducts work that involves computer-based cognitive tasks, neurological and physiological measurement, as well as statistical modelling of data. These are skills that will be useful in your future careers. A key part of being a researcher is recognising what you don’t know and seeking out opportunities to learn. We don’t expect you to know how to do all of this immediately, but we expect you to want to know how. We will support you in your learning, but as a researcher, you need to take an active role in enhancing your skills.\nEveryone can be supportive colleague. This means being respectful and supportive of others, being open to feedback and constructive criticism, and being willing to help others when needed. Good science is collaborative: we all succeed when we work together.\nEveryone can be an ambassador for the lab. As a member of the lab, you represent the lab, the department and the university. Passion and enthusiasm for the work we do is important, and we want you to share that with others. This means being professional in your interactions with others, both inside and outside the lab.\nEveryone can have a life outside the lab. We want you to be happy and healthy. We think our work is important, but it is not the only thing that matters. The combination of passion for work and flexibility of hours that comes with being a researcher can be a a huge benefit but also contribute to stress and difficulty disconnecting. If you are struggling with this, please talk to us. We want to help you find a balance that works for you.\n\n\nLab leads\nThe lab leads (Dr. Wilson and Dr. Medimorec) are responsible for the overall direction of the lab and its research agenda. They are also responsible for mentoring and supporting lab members, ensuring that the lab is a positive and productive environment.\nWe supervise Undergraduate, Postgraduate and Doctoral students in accordance with the university’s policies and procedures. To that end, the lab is an additional, voluntary opportunity for students, which exists in addition to (not a replacement for) the normal supervision process.\nAs supervisors, we will always prioritise the academic needs of our students and support them to meet their academic goals. We do not require students to join the lab, and students in the lab are not required to work on projects that are not aligned with their academic goals. Additionally, supervisees who join the lab are not treated differently, in an academic sense, from supervisees who are not in the lab.\nThe lab is an opportunity for students who wish to, to gain experience working in collaborative research teams, to learn about the research process and to develop their skills alongside other researchers who are at different stages of their academic career.\nWe will:\n\nSupport you in your academic and professional development\nProvide you with opportunities to learn and develop your skills\nProvide you with opportunities to conduct research and publish your work\nBe available to answer your questions and provide feedback\nKeep you in the loop about the direction of the lab and its research agenda and allow you to contribute to that agenda\n\n\n\nDoctoral students\nDoctoral students are taking the first steps in their academic careers, but in the lab are relatively senior members of the team. The lab leads will support you in your development as a researcher and aim to put you in the best position to succeed in your academic career.\nDoctoral students will (with the support of the lab leads):\n\nConduct the research that is the focus of their doctoral studies\nPresent their work at lab meetings and other events\nSupport and mentor undergraduate and MSc students\nEngage in professional development and networking opportunities appropriate to doctoral level and in line with their career goals\nPublish their work in peer-reviewed journals and present at conferences\nSeek out appropriate funding opportunities to support their research\n\nWe will support doctoral students in applying for external funding to support their research and dissemination. We will also support doctoral students in applying for post-doctoral positions and other academic opportunities.\n\n\nMSc students\nMSc students are expected to take a more active role in the lab than undergraduate students. They might be considering a career in research and the lab is a good opportunity to gain experience and develop their skills.\nMSc students will (with the support of the lab leads and doctoral students):\n\nConduct the research that is the focus of their MSc studies\nPresent their work at lab meetings and other events\nSupport and mentor undergraduate students\nEngage in skills development and learning opportunities appropriate to MSc level and in line with their career goals\n\nMSc students might publish their work in peer-reviewed journals and present at conferences, but this will often be dependent on the nature of their MSc project or as part of a larger project. We will support MSc students to apply for external bursaries to support their research or dissemination.\n\n\nUndergraduate students\nUndergraduate students are expected to take an active role in the lab, but they are also at the beginning of their academic careers. Being a member of the lab is about learning from the other researchers and developing your skills.\nUndergraduate students will (with the support of the lab leads and doctoral/MSc students):\n\nConduct the research that is the focus of their undergraduate dissertation\nPresent their work at lab meetings and other events (where appropriate)\n\nUndergraduate students might publish their work in peer-reviewed journals as part of a larger project. We will also support undergraduate students in applying for student conferences, if they are interested in doing so.\n\n\nResearch assistants/associates\nResearch assistants and associates are typically early career researchers who are looking to gain experience in a lab environment. They may be working on a specific project or providing support to the lab leads and other lab members.\nSome RAs will be employed as part of a funded project, while others may be volunteering their time to gain experience. In either case, we will support RAs in their development as researchers and aim to put them in the best position to succeed in their academic careers.\nRAs will (with the support of the lab leads and other lab members):\n\nConduct the research that is the focus of their project. Funded RAs will work the hours defined in their contract, while volunteer RAs will work on their project as time allows, in consultation with the lab leads\nPresent their work at lab meetings as appropriate\nContribute to external engagement and dissemination activities related to their project\nEngage in professional development and networking opportunities appropriate to their career goals\nPublish their work in peer-reviewed journals and present at conferences (as appropriate)\n\nWe will support RAs in applying for external funding to support their research and dissemination. We will also support RAs in applying for post-graduate/post-doctoral positions and other academic opportunities (as appropriate)."

    "text": "Lab culture and practices\nGood research comes from good practices. Part of joining a lab is about learning how to conduct research that is rigorous and scientifically valid. This means learning about the research process, the methods we use and how to conduct research in a way that is ethical and responsible.\nThis is an ongoing process and involves learning from each other, sharing ideas and feedback, and being open to new ways of thinking about research. For these experiences to happen, regular engagement and communication is essential. It is through this engagement that we grow as researchers and achieve the level of excellence and impact the we are aspiring to.\n\nLab meetings\nLab meetings are an important part of the lab culture. They are a place for everyone to come together to discuss their work, share ideas and provide feedback to each other. Lab meetings are held regularly and the schedule will be shared on the website and the lab calendar. Attendance at lab meetings is expected for all lab members, notwithstanding any other commitments (e.g., teaching, placements, etc.).\nEveryone will get an opportunity to present their work at lab meetings. This might be a formal presentation or a more informal discussion of your work. The aim is to provide a supportive environment where everyone can share their ideas and get feedback from others. As well as contributing to the lab culture, this is an important part of your development as a researcher and helps prepare you for presenting your work at conferences and other events.\n\n\nResearch seminars\nThe psychology department hosts a series of research seminars throughout the year. These are an opportunity to hear from other speakers about their work and to engage in discussions about current research in psychology. Attendance at these seminars is strongly encouraged for all lab members, and we encourage you to ask questions and engage with the speakers. Lab members will also present their work at these seminars and we will support you in preparing for these presentations.\n\n\nResearch integrity\nResearch integrity is about conducting research in a way that is ethical and responsible. This means being transparent about your methods and findings, adhering to ethical guidelines and regulations, and being open to feedback and constructive criticism. As a pschyology lab, we are bound by the British Psychological Society’s Code of Ethics and Conduct, as well as the university’s policies and procedures. All lab members are expected to be familiar with these guidelines and rules (consistent with their level of experience), before conducting any work. We will support you in understanding these guidelines and how to apply them to your work.\n\n\nOpen science and reproducable research\nOpen science is about making research more transparent and accessible. This means sharing your data, methods and findings with others, and being open to feedback and constructive criticism. Reproducible research is about conducting research in a way that allows others to replicate your work. This is an important part of the scientific process and helps to ensure that research is robust and reliable. We use the Open Science Framework (OSF) to share our data, methods and findings with others.\nAll projects conducted in the lab will be registered on the OSF and all data and materials will be shared on the OSF. Pre-registration of studies is the default for all projects.\nWe will have consistent approaches to our OSF usage. We will support you in understanding how to use the OSF and how to apply open science principles to your work."

    "text": "Abstract\nPeople adjust the way they speak and write depending on the situation. For example, they may simplify their language when addressing children or older adults. Such adjustments likely help make communication clearer and easier to understand, which is especially important in instructional settings. In a series of studies, we first demonstrated that speech characteristics vary systematically across academic disciplines. For instance, science lectures often present conceptually difficult material but tend to compensate by using simpler syntax. We then examined how these linguistic variations in lectures relate to student learning. Specifically, we tested whether computationally derived measures of language difficulty could predict performance on multiple-choice and short-answer assessments. Our findings demonstrate a strong relationship between lecture language features and students’ memory."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nPrevious research has indicated that social relationships are a strong factor in the maintenance of gambling harms. There are certain sports (e.g., football), wherein gambling has become a normalised part of socialising within these groups. However, while some research has found sports participation is a predictor of gambling behaviour, there is a lack of work exploring how social identification with sports groups might predict gambling and which aspects of gambling it might be linked to (e.g., frequency of gambling, amount gambled, attitudes to gambling). Furthermore, while we know little about how socialisation can lead to gambling in families, we know little about how people experience the normalisation of gambling within wider social groups.\nThis current project, funded by the AFSG aims to explore how social identification with sports groups is linked to gambling behaviour; to explore which aspects of gambling behaviour are predicted by social identification with sports groups and to explore how people experience the normalisation of gambling within sports social groups."

In the meantime, please get in touch if you would like more information about any of the tasks listed below.\n\nDecision under risk (based on Rogers et al., 1999). Commonly referred to as “The Cambridge Gambling Task”, this task was first published by Rogers et al., in 1999. This is a computerized task that assesses decision-making under risk. Participants are presented with a series of gambles and must decide whether to accept or reject each gamble. The task is designed to measure risk-taking behavior and has been used in a range of studies investigating decision-making in healthy and clinical populations. We have implemented this task in JSPsych and also have a version of the task that is modified for fNIRS, including delays in the feedback to account for the hemodynamic response, and serial port communication to synchronize the task with the fNIRS data.\nWorking Memory We use a version of the Operation Span task to assess working memory capacity. In this task, participants are presented with a series of math problems and must remember the answer to each problem. At the end of each set of problems, participants are asked to recall the answers in the order they were presented. This task is designed to measure working memory capacity and has been used in a range of studies investigating working memory in healthy and clinical populations. This version of the task has been implemented in JSPsych.\nGlobal and Local Processing We use a version of the Navon task to assess global and local processing. In this task, participants are presented with a large letter made up of smaller letters. Participants must respond to either the large letter (global level) or the smaller letters (local level). This task is designed to measure the extent to which participants process information at the global or local level and has been used in a range of studies investigating cognitive processing in healthy and clinical populations. This version of the task has been implemented in JSPsych.\nEyewitness lineup identification We have implemented a simultaneous lineup task to assess eyewitness identification accuracy. In this task, participants are presented with a lineup of faces and must identify the face they saw during a previous event. This includes a confidence rating response based on the “cup half full” scale. This task is designed to measure eyewitness identification accuracy and has been used in a range of studies investigating eyewitness memory in adult and child populations. This version of the task has been implemented in JSPsych."
