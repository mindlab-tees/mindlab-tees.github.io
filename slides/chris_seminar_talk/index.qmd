## Aims of this talk

-   To outline a developing research programme on the cognitive neuroscience of gambling harms

-   To explore a currently active project on the role of social identity and the normalisation of gambling in sports groups

-   To discuss some planned research and future directions

::: notes
I was originally going to talk about a single project which is currently ongoing.

While I will still talk about this, I thought it might be more suitable for this seminar series to outline the programme of work that is currently taking place in our lab, involving funded research projects with Research Associates, Doctoral Students, MSc students and UG projects.

# Background and Context

## The multi-dimensional nature of gambling harms

![Measuring gambling-related harms (Wardle et al., 2018)](images/semodel.png){width="1326"}

## The regulatory context

-   The failure of "soft friction"

-   Cognitive knowledge is used for exploitative purposes - could be used positively

-   "Self-exclusion" failure and cue reactivity

-   Need for behavioural measures of harm that assess risk-taking behaviour

::: notes
-   **Example A: The Failure of "Soft Friction" (The "Pop-Up" Problem)**

    -   **The Evidence:** Use the **Gamesys** and **Petfre (Betfred)** enforcement cases from the UKGC bulletins. These operators used "soft" interactions (like emails or pop-ups) which players simply ignored while continuing to lose thousands of pounds .

    -   **The Rationale Point:** "Policy currently relies on 'soft friction'—asking people to stop. The regulatory data proves this fails because the 'hot' cognitive state (the urge) overrides the intervention. We need neuroscience to design 'hard friction' that actually engages the prefrontal cortex."

    **Example B: "Losses Disguised as Wins" (The Cognitive Exploit)**

    -   **The Evidence:** The UKGC "Safer by Design" mandate banned features where a player loses money (e.g., 50p return on a £1 bet) but the machine plays celebratory music .

    -   **The Rationale Point:** "Gambling products are engineered to exploit specific neural errors. 'Losses Disguised as Wins' trick the striatum into releasing dopamine during a financial loss. My programme investigates how to reverse-engineer these exploits."

    **Example C: The "Self-Exclusion" Failure (Cue-Reactivity)**

    -   **The Evidence:** Operators have been fined for sending marketing emails to self-excluded players. This acts as a "hot cue" that triggers immediate craving and relapse, bypassing the player's "cool" pre-commitment .

    -   **The Rationale Point:** "This isn't just a marketing error; it’s a 'cue-reactivity' failure. We are using fNIRS to map exactly how these digital triggers hijack the brain's control systems."

## The social context

-   Increasing prevalence of gambling advertisement

-   Normalisation (Norm-congruence) of gambling as a part of sports engagement [@duggan2022; @jetten2017]

-   The symbolic construction of sports betting [@lopez-gonzalez2021]

::: notes
gambling has started to become norm-congruent behaviour within these social groups, which in-turn makes it an acceptable, or even expected, behaviour for those who want to see themselves as a prototypical group member (Jetten et al., 2017).
:::

## The research silos

-   Recent review of interventions for treatment of harmful gambling found 8 studies, all of which were retrospective - no experimental work [@seel2024]

-   We can identify neural deficits linked to gambling disorder (prefrontal-stratial dysregulation) but there is a call for "new interventions" which incorporate this knowledge [@raimo2021]

-   Behavioural intervention research calls for further understanding of the neurobiological changes that take place with interventions [@schwebel2020]

# The Research Programme

## 

![](images/gambling_research_prog1.png){fig-align="center" width="1235"}

::: notes
The work seeks to integrate four strands:

1.  **Social Context** (The Environment)

2.  **Clinical Vulnerability** (The Individual)

3.  **Cognitive Moderators** (The Tools)

4.  **Neural Mechanisms** (The Underlying Biology)
:::

## Clinical Vulnerabilities

-   **Doctoral Work:** *Cognitive Inhibition and Cognitive Flexibility as moderators of Depression and Problem Gambling.* ***Ema Abir*** (DClin)

-   **Doctoral Work:** *How risk imperception and reward magnitude moderate the relationship between subclinical hypomania and decision making.* ***David Minchella*** (DClin)

-   **Doctoral Work:** *The role of impulsivity and working memory in the the relationship between subclinical hypomania and decision making. **Alana Gadsby*** (DClin)

-   **Completed Study** Wilson, C.J., Medimorec, S., Naganathan, J *et al.* (in prep) Risk Imperception, Not Reward Focus Underlies Poor Gambling Decisions in Subclinical Hypomania.

-   **Study:** *Anxiety & Decision-Making.* Investigating how anxiety specifically impacts decision quality vs. risk-taking. ***Summer Hall***

::: notes
Finishing data collecton on DM and AG studies

UG is a pilot study

All involve both neural mechanisms and cognitive moderators
:::

## Social Context

-   **Funded Project:** “It’s part of the sport”: Exploring how social identification with sports groups predicts gambling behaviour and how people experience the normalisation of gambling with sports groups.

-   **Study:** *Sports Engagement & Implicit Associations.* Testing if high sports engagement predicts a stronger implicit cognitive association between "Sport" and "Gambling." ***Thomas Wilkinson***

-   **Review:** *Systematic Review on the efficacy of gambling harms policy-related interventions.* **w/ Dr. Andrew Richardson**

::: notes
:::

## Cognitive Mechanisms

-   **Published Study:** @wilson2026 demonstrated that cognitive adaptations (construal mindset) can influence neural risk sensitivity in the Lateral Pre-frontal Cortex and affect risk-taking behaviour

    -   This is an proof-of concept experimental demonstration of the "hot-to-cool" shift that the gambling commission were advocating

-   **Study:** *Short-Form Video Adverts.* Testing if exposure to gambling adverts in short-form video content alters risk-taking behaviour. ***Theia Morgan***

# Focus: "It's part of the sport" project

![](/images/afsg_logo.png){width="500"}

::: notes
What the preceding slides show is a body of work that is being conducted within our lab which tackles this problem across the different domains I mentioned earlier.

Of course, the UG work might be considered pilots or proof of concept.

We also have a series of doctoral projects that involve complex cognitive neuroscience experiements, behavioural and cogntiive measures of risk-taking

Published work and papers under submission and in perparation

## Project Team

![](images/afsg_project_team.png){fig-align="center" width="100%"}

## Project Background

-   Discourse around reducing harms is still heavily focused on the individual [@marko2022]

-   Failure of research to epistemologically consider the broader context in which gambling takes place, has led to too much focus on individual pathology [@borrell2005]

-   “urgent need to identify predictors of disordered gambling in people who gamble recreationally \[…\] particularly across relationship \[… \] domains” [@bowden-jones2022]

## The Social Component

-   Socialisation through family or peer groups is a common starting point in the initiation of gambling behaviour [@reith2011]

-   Problem gambling has been found to be associated with conformity to group norms [@atteoksanen2021]

-   It is potentially much more valuable to understand how identification with other social groups could lead to gambling.

    -   to engage with them at any level (e.g., amateur players or fan) is to be exposed to gambling [@constandt2022]

## Research Questions

> We theorise that gambling has started to become norm-congruent behaviour within these social groups, which in-turn makes it an acceptable, or even expected, behaviour for those who want to see themselves as a prototypical group member [@jetten2017]

-   Research Question 1: Which aspects of gambling behaviour are linked to social identification with sports groups?

-   Research Question 2: Is the relationship between sports engagement and gambling behaviour moderated by social identification with sports groups?

-   Research Question 3: How do people experience the normalisation of gambling within sports social groups?

## Methodology

-   Mixed methods approach

-   WP1: a cross-sectional survey-based study

-   WP 2: a qualitative study.

-   WP 3: a synthesis of these ideas into recommendations for stakeholders

## Progress and current Status

-   Targeted recruitment at sports organisations and fan groups

-   Survey data collection (current n = 120)

-   Interviews currently being scheduled

# Why does this work matter?

-   UKGC is shifting to "safer by design" requirements for operators. "Soft friction" doesn't work. Need to establish evidence base for what does.

-   Multi-dimensional models of gambling harms call for integration of behavioural, cognitive, neural and social mechanisms. A programme of research is needed to connect these.

-   We are working to understand:

    -   What are the specific neural mechanisms involved

    -   How cognitive processes affect risk behaviour specifically

    -   How trait-level social constructs (e.g., fan identity) moderate the link between community and behaviour

# What's next?

-   **The Next Challenge:** Can we use this understanding of process to *engineer* better harm-reduction tools?

-   **The goal:** To move beyond *describing* harm to *preventing* it, developing neuro-informed frameworks for safer gambling environments.

# Thank you
