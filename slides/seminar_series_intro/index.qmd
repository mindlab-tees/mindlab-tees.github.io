## The Human Element {data-background-image="https://images.pexels.com/photos/3184292/pexels-photo-3184292.jpeg" data-background-opacity="0.1"}

::: {.incremental}
-   Contemporary challenges like misinformation, social isolation, and trauma are often viewed through a political or economic lens.
-   At their core, however, they are fundamentally human problems, rooted in cognition, emotion, and social identity.
-   Research provides us with the tools to understand these challenges, to support individuals and communities, and to start looking for solutions.

# Navigating the information maze { .section}

How our emotions are affecting what we believe and the decision we make.

:::{.notes}

Perhaps one of the biggest challenges of our time is the way that misinformation spreads online, shaping beliefs and behaviours in ways that can be deeply harmful. This is not just a technological problem, but a profoundly psychological one. Understanding how people process information, how emotions shape our judgments, and how social identity influences our sense of truth is essential for developing effective strategies to counter misinformation and promote healthier public discourse.

For individuals with strong conspiratorial beliefs, fear-based health appeals can be counterproductive, triggering defiance instead of compliance.

> “Instead, the more anxious they become about infection, the more they blame the system and react against it...”
:::
:::

::: {.notes}
Dr. Copping's research reveals a critical paradox in public health messaging. It demonstrates the psychological principle of **reactance**, where a perceived attempt at control triggers defiance. For individuals who already distrust institutions, fear appeals are not seen as warnings but as coercion, leading to an active rejection of recommended behaviours. This work shows that public health messaging must be psychologically informed to be effective across different segments of the population.

Cybersecurity decisions are often driven by the **"affect heuristic"**—our immediate "gut feelings"—rather than logic. A fraudulent email promising a prize elicits positive feelings that can override a rational assessment of its legitimacy.
:::
:::

::: {.notes}
Dr. Wilson's work provides robust evidence for the role of the affect heuristic in cybersecurity. This mental shortcut means judgments are heavily influenced by immediate emotional responses. If something feels good, we judge its risks as low; if it feels bad, we do the opposite. This insight is critical for understanding why people fall for online manipulation. Enhancing digital literacy requires educating individuals about their own cognitive and emotional biases, encouraging a pause for analytical thought when emotional stakes are high.

Contrary to stereotypes, healthcare professionals are "overwhelmingly positive" toward internet-informed patients, shifting their communication strategy **"from compliance to co-construction"** to build a shared understanding.
:::
:::

::: {.notes}
Dr. Walker's research reveals a collaborative reality in clinical practice. The goal is no longer for the patient to simply comply, but for both parties to co-construct a shared plan. This shows that the potential harms of online misinformation can be mitigated through a strong, trusting therapeutic relationship. When patients feel safe to disclose their online research, it allows clinicians to address misconceptions, validate correct information, and integrate the patient's priorities into a shared decision-making process.

**Dr. Heather Clements**
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
Dr. Clements' research reveals a complex reality about pets and loneliness during the pandemic. Quantitative data showed no direct association; in fact, more engagement with pets was linked to poorer outcomes, likely because those already lonely sought more comfort from them.
:::
:::

::: {.notes}
This is a prime example of why careful psychological research is so valuable. A superficial interpretation might be that interacting with pets is detrimental. However, a more sophisticated analysis suggests the opposite causal relationship. It is likely that individuals who were *already* experiencing greater loneliness were the ones who sought out more engagement from their pets as a coping mechanism. The animal is not the cause of the poor outcome but a response to it.

For destitute asylum seekers, loneliness is an active product of social exclusion. The research highlights that a therapist's validating presence can be a lifeline, directly counteracting the dehumanising effects of their circumstances.
:::
:::

::: {.notes}
This work powerfully illustrates that loneliness is not merely a passive state. For marginalised groups, it is often an active product of social and political forces. The psychological response, therefore, must be equally active. It is not about teaching "social skills" but about the fundamental human act of creating a safe, trusting, and affirming relationship, providing an antidote to the isolation engendered by systemic hostility.

:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
A student's belief that "I can do this" is powerfully reinforced by the feeling that "I belong here, with these people." Social identification is a key predictor of wellbeing and academic confidence.
:::
:::

::: {.notes}
Dr. Sander's research on "Academic Behavioural Confidence" shows that a student's confidence is not formed in a vacuum but is powerfully reinforced by social identification and a feeling of belonging. This work shows that fostering community is a powerful, evidence-based strategy for promoting individual success.

Practical, place-based initiatives like the 'Redcar Community Kitchen' create a shared purpose where individuals from different backgrounds can build the informal social networks that are the bedrock of a resilient community.
:::
:::

::: {.notes}
Dr. O'Neill's work in community psychology demonstrates a commitment to Asset-Based Community Development. This approach moves away from focusing on a community's needs and instead builds upon its existing strengths. The 'Redcar Community Kitchen' project was designed to "bring together different parts of the community to increase social connectedness." This shows how psychology can be applied to actively design environments that combat loneliness from the ground up.

A key finding from discursive psychology is that strategies used to disguise talk as 'not racist' are also used to justify explicitly racist talk. Understanding these linguistic tactics is the first step toward deconstructing them.
:::
:::

::: {.notes}
Dr. Burke's research moves beyond simply labelling discourse as hateful and instead performs a fine-grained analysis of the rhetorical strategies used to make such views appear legitimate. By analysing tactics like appealing to "common sense" or constructing minorities as a threat, her research provides a "playbook" for how prejudice is laundered into seemingly acceptable public discourse. This work is vital for fostering a more critical and resilient civic dialogue.

:::
:::

::: {.notes}
Prof. Eberhardt's research exemplifies a critical evolution in tackling systemic inequality. The concept of "co-production" rejects a model where outside "experts" design interventions *for* a community. Instead, it involves working *with* community members as equal partners. This process builds trust and ensures the final product is culturally resonant, providing a powerful, evidence-based blueprint for tackling health inequalities.

Public stigma against former offenders, "fueled by media portrayals and misconceptions," can create a self-defeating feedback loop. It creates barriers to the very factors known to reduce reoffending, like stable housing and employment.
:::
:::

::: {.notes}
Dr. Gair's research highlights a dangerous societal dynamic. Public stigma creates political pressure for policies that prioritise punishment over evidence-based rehabilitation. These policies, in turn, make successful reintegration nearly impossible, potentially undermining the goal of enhancing long-term public safety. Her work demonstrates the vital role of forensic psychology in bringing evidence to a highly emotional public debate.

This research represents a crucial move away from a deterministic model where trauma inevitably leads to negative outcomes. By demonstrating that a subset of students can flourish despite adversity, and by identifying the specific psychological resources that enable this, Dr. Carthy's work provides an evidence-based roadmap for intervention. The powerful implication is that institutions can play an active role in creating an environment where students who have experienced trauma are given the tools to thrive.

:::
:::

This perspective has profound implications for therapeutic intervention. It suggests that treating individuals in isolation is insufficient. An effective response must also address the community-level dimensions of the trauma, supporting processes of collective healing, reinforcing cultural identity, and acknowledging the ongoing social stressors of displacement and marginalisation. This demands a more socially and culturally attuned approach to healing.

Effective care must address the whole person, not just a condition. Research into conditions like adult-onset epilepsy encourages healthcare practitioners to look beyond medical management and consider the impact on a person's total wellbeing.
:::
:::

::: {.notes}
Dr. Kilinc's work into the lived experience of patients has led to the development of new self-management frameworks. It is a powerful reminder that a condition is something a person *has*, not who they *are*, and that effective care must address the whole person.

Children's picture books can "offer a potentially safe way to allow adults and children to talk about and ask questions about death together." This approach helps demystify a difficult topic and fosters emotional literacy from an early age.
:::
:::

::: {.notes}
Maggie Jackson's research in Death Education focuses on addressing societal silence around loss in a gentle way. Her work shows the value of approaching this not with a specific therapeutic goal, but as a normal part of life. By using picture books, children and adults are provided with a shared language and narrative to process one of life's most profound experiences.

The climate crisis is a profound psychological issue. Foundational work on how to measure emotional responses like eco-anxiety is essential for understanding its true mental health impact and developing effective, evidence-based interventions.
:::
:::

::: {.notes}
Dr. Marcin Owczarek's systematic review of the tools used to measure climate-related emotional responses found a need for "more rigorous methodological standards and theoretical clarity". By ensuring that concepts like eco-anxiety are measured accurately and consistently, psychology can better identify vulnerable populations and develop appropriate support.
