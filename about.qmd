The Wilson-Medimorec MIND Lab is a collaborative research group co-led by Dr Christopher wilson and Dr Srdan Medmiorec, who are based within the Department of Psychology at Teesside University.

Established in 2024, the group serves as the central hub for the research programmes, grants, and outputs led by Principal Investigators Dr. Christopher Wilson and Dr. Srdan Medimorec. By pooling our resources and expertise, we  provide a structured and focused research environment for our students, supervisees and collaborators.
