## Aims of the research:  

The aims of this project are: to explore how social identification with sports groups is linked to gambling behaviour; to explore which aspects of gambling behaviour are predicted by social identification with sports groups; to explore how people experience the normalisation of gambling within sports social groups; and to synthesise our findings into recommendations for relevant stakeholders, to support their approaches gambling harm reduction. 

Previous research has indicated that social relationships are a strong factor in the maintenance of gambling harms. There are certain sports (e.g., football), wherein gambling has become a normalised part of socialising within these groups. However, while some research has found sports participation is a predictor of gambling behaviour, there is a lack of work exploring how social identification with sports groups might predict gambling and which aspects of gambling it might be linked to (e.g., frequency of gambling, amount gambled, attitudes to gambling). Furthermore, while we know little about how socialisation can lead to gambling in families, we know little about how people experience the normalisation of gambling within wider social groups.

If you have any further questions about this study, please contact [Dr. Christopher Wilson](mailto:christopher.wilson@tees.ac.uk?subject=Research%20Participation%20Query).

You may withdraw your data from this research at any point up to 7 days from the date of your interview. Within this timeframe, you will be contacted to confirm that you are happy with the interview transcript, and asked if you would like to withdraw from the study, if you choose.  

**When will I receive my token of appreciation?:** if you provided your email to receive a shopping voucher for participation, you will receive an email within aprox. 7 days, subject to verification of responses (anti-fraud measures). We need to ensure that all responses are genuine, including that participants are based in the UK, and are part of the sports groups which are participating in the study. If we are unsure, we will be in touch to confirm.
