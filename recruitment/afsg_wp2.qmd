Hello, my name is ***Christopher Wilson*** and I am an Associate Professor in the School of Social Sciences, Humanities and Law, Teesside University. I am undertaking a research projectand I would like to invite you to take part. Before you decide if you want to please read the following information and discuss it with others if you wish. Please contact me if you have any questions: [Dr. Christopher Wilson](mailto:christopher.wilson@tees.ac.uk?subject=Research%20Participation%20Query)

**What is the purpose of the study?**

This study aims to understand the relationship between engagement with sports and gambling behaviour.

**Why am I being invited to take part?**

You have been invited because I believe you are a member of a sports club or a person who regularly follows watches sports and you have expressed an interest in being interviewed about this topic. 

To be able to take part though you must be:

-   at least 18 years old

-   are a member of a sports club or a person who regularly follows watches sports

**Do I have to take part?**

No, it’s up to you if you want to, or not.

**What would I be asked to do if I chose to take part?**

You will be interviewed about the topic of gambling in sports groups, including your experiences of this subject. You agree to take part in a Teams interview which involves using a webcam and that the interview will be recorded for the purposes of transcription. 

**What are the possible disadvantages, or risks, of taking part?**

We do not anticipate any specific risks. However, if you feel uncomfortable answering questions on this topic then you do not have to take part. You can also choose to withdraw your participation at any time during the study. 

***What are the possible benefits to taking part?***

We hope to gain a better understanding of the links between sports participation and gambling behaviour. In the future, we believe this could lead to more targeted support for those who suffer from gambling harms.

**What would happen to the information collected about me?**

The interviews will be recorded and the recordings will be stored in password protected Teesside University storage, managed by the principal investigator and accessible by the researchers named on this form. Transcripts of the interviews will also be created and stored in the same way. 

What you say in the interview will be anonymised. The transcript will be identified only by a pseudonym (a fake name), and any information that could identify you will be redacted.   

Once written transcripts have been created, you will be given an opportunity to verify their accuracy. Once this has been done, the recordings of the interviews will be deleted. However, the transcripts from the interviews (in anonymised form) will be retained indefinitely, and used for the purposes of research, which will include publication of data in reports, research articles and in data repositories such as the open science framework (OSF).  

If you wish to receive a token of compensation for taking part in this study (£10 shopping voucher), you will be asked to provide your email address so that the e-voucher can be emailed to you from the voucher provider. You can choose not to do this, but if you provide your email address, it will be stored separately from your interview transcript, to preserve your anonymity. Your email address will be used only for this purpose, and only retained until the end of this research project (31/03/26). 

**Are there any circumstances under which my confidentiality could be breached?** 

This would only happen if you disclose any information during interviews that the researcher feels may result in harm to the participants or others, the researcher will need to breach confidentiality in order to inform the lead researcher. The researcher will then inform appropriate agencies in order to maintain the safety of those involved.  

The researcher will act in accordance with the British Psychological Society’s Code of Human Research Ethics (2021) and the BPS Code of Ethics and Conduct (2021). 

**When will I receive my token of appreciation:** if you provide your email to receive a £15 shopping voucher for participation, you will receive an email within aprox. 7 days, subject to verification of responses (anti-fraud measures). We need to ensure that all responses are genuine, including that participants are based in the UK, and are part of the sports groups which are participating in the study. If we are unsure, we will be in touch to confirm.  

Personal data including special category data obtained for the purposes of this research project is processed lawfully in the necessary performance of scientific or historical research or for statistical purposes carried out in the public interest. Processing of personal data including special category data is proportionate to the aims pursued, respects the essence of data protection and provides suitable and specific measures to safeguard the rights and interests of the data subject in full compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation and the Data Protection Act 2018.
