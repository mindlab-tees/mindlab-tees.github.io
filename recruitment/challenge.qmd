## Q&A

### What is the purpose of this research challenge?

A. Lab-based experiments are an important part of the evidence base in psychology. To do this work, we need people to come to the lab. However, we understand that it is not easy to give up your time to take part.

### Who is eligible to enter?

A. Anyone who participates in these two specific studies (the ones on this page) via the SONA platform.

### What vouchers are available

A. 1 x £100, 1 x £50, 2 x £25. The same person cannot win more than one voucher.

### When will the draw take place?

A. The draw will take place either when the studies have completed recruiting all of the participants needed, or at the end of Semester 2 (whichever comes first). The latest date that the draw takes place will be 31st May 2026.

### How will I know that the draw has taken place?

A. Everyone who opts into the draw will be contacted via an email from the SONA system to let them know that the draw took place. The winners will be contacted individually.
