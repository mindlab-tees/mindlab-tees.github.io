The COBI fNIRS R package is a collection of functions for processing and analyzing functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) data. The package provides functions for importing, preprocessing and visualising fNIRS data that has been recorded in COBI studio.

The package is in early development and should be used with caution. Please check all outputs and results carefully.

If you have questions or would like to contribute to the package, please get in touch.

The github repository for the package can be found [here](https://github.com/christopherjwilson/cobifnirs).
