The MIND Lab is based in the Department of Psychology at Teesside University. The lab is co-led by Dr Christopher Wilson and Dr Srdan Medimorec.

We are interested in understanding the cognitive and neural mechanisms underlying decision-making, learning, and memory. We use a range of methods, including functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), eye-tracking, and virtual reality, to study these processes in both healthy and clinical populations.
