The MIND Lab is based in the Department of Psychology at Teesside University. The lab is co-led by Dr Christopher Wilson and Dr Srdan Medimorec.

We work to understand the cognitive and neural mechanisms underlying decision-making, learning, and memory. Specific strands of work being led by Dr. Wilson (decision-making under risk: gambling, financial decision-making) and Dr. Medimorec (language, meta-cognition, implicit learning). We use a range of methods, including functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), eye-tracking, and virtual reality, to study these processes in both healthy and clinical populations.
