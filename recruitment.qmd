In the lab, we are running many studies at any one time.  Because of the type of research we do, we often need participants to come into the lab. We are located in the Themis Building at Teesside University. 

Research participation is an essential part of the scientific process. It allows us to test our hypotheses, gather data, and ultimately to the research that makes an impact in the real world. 

The ultimate goal of our research is to improve people's lives. To do this, we need to understand how people think, feel, and behave. By participating in our studies, you are helping us to gain this understanding.

## What does taking part involve?

This depends on the study. Some studies may involve completing questionnaires, while others may involve performing tasks on a computer. Some studies may require you to come into the lab, while others can be completed online. Each study will have a detailed description of what is involved, so you can decide if it is something you would like to take part in.

Before taking part in any study, you will be provided with an information sheet that explains the study in detail. You will also have the opportunity to ask any questions you may have. You would then indicate your consent to take part by singing a consent form (or providing electronic consent on a computer).

## Is there any compensation for taking part?

This depends on the study. Some studies may offer compensation in the form of vouchers or a prize draw, while others may offer research participation credit (for students). Some studies may not offer any compensation at all. 

This will be clearly stated in the study description. 

## How to take part in our studies (Teesside University students and staff)
