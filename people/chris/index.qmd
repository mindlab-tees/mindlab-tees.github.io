::: {#hero-heading}
I am an Associate Professor in the Department of Psychology at Teesside University, where I lead The MIND Lab.

My primary research programme is focused on understanding and reducing gambling-related harm. I apply cognitive neuroscience and neuroeconomic approaches to investigate the real-world factors that influence risky decision-making.

Further details of my research programme can be found here: [The Cognitive Neuroscience of Gambling Behaviour](../../research/gambling.html)

In the lab, I use fNIRS, Eyetracking, and web-based experimental approaches in this work. I use R for data analysis and jsPsych for coding experiments.
