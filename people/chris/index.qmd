::: {#hero-heading}
I am an Associate Professor in the Department of Psychology at Teesside University. My research focuses on decision-making and attention related to risk. I am particularly interested in economic decision-making, which includes topics such as gambling. I am also interested in the application of neuroeconomic approaches to understanding decision-making in other domains, such as clinical psychology.

In the lab, I use [fNIRS](/tools/fnirs.qmd), Eyetracking, Virtual Reality and web-based experimental approaches in this work. I use R for data analysis and 
jsPsych for coding experiments.
