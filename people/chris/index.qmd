::: {#hero-heading}
I am an Associate Professor in the Department of Psychology at Teesside University, where I lead The MIND Lab.

My primary research programme is focused on understanding and reducing gambling-related harm. I apply cognitive neuroscience and neuroeconomic approaches to investigate the real-world factors that influence risky decision-making.

This research programme takes a multi-dimensonal approach to the topic:

- Cognitive Moderators (e.g., attention, memory, numeracy, financial literacy).

- Clinical Vulnerability (e.g., depression, hypomania, anxiety).

- The Social Context (e.g., sports engagement, social identity).

- Neurological correlates of decision-making and risk-taking.

In the lab, I use fNIRS, Eyetracking, and web-based experimental approaches in this work. I use R for data analysis and jsPsych for coding experiments.
