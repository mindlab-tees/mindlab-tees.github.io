My research program is focused on investigating metacognition (the way people think about their own minds) and implicit learning (learning that takes place without awareness and explicit instructions). I am also interested in the effects of individual differences and contextual factors on language processing. Much of my research is experimental and lab-based. The experiments that we conduct in the MIND lab are computer-based cognition, language processing, memory, and learning studies.
