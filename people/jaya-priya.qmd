I’m currently a Master’s student in Applied Psychology with a strong interest in the brain and behaviour. During my time at the lab, I have worked on several studies, including [hypomania and risk-taking](http://themindlab.uk/posters/hypomania_poster.pdf) bahaviour. My goal is to pursue a PhD in the future.
