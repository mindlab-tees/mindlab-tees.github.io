I’m currently a Master’s student in Applied Psychology with a strong interest in the brain, behaviour, and neurodevelopmental disorders. I’m particularly passionate about understanding how the brain develops, adapts, and interacts with neurodivergent conditions. My goal is to pursue a PhD in the future and contribute to research that explores the unanswered questions in this field.
