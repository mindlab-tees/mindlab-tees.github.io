I’m have recently completed a Master’s in Applied Psychology at Teesside University. I have a strong interest in the brain and behaviour. During my time at the lab, I have worked on several studies, including [hypomania and risk-taking](http://themindlab.uk/posters/hypomania_poster.pdf) behaviour. My goal is to pursue a PhD in the future. I am currently working as a research associate on the UKRI/AHRC funded gambling harms evidence review project.
