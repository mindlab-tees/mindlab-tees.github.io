David is a doctorate trainee (2026) interested in the cognitive and neural mechanisms underlying risk-taking behavior in hypomania. His project focuses on the potential moderating roles of reward focus and risk perception. He used functional near infrared spectroscopy to look at neural activation. 

Update: David passed his viva voce examination in September 2025.
