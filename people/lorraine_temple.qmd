Lorraine works as a research associate on the ASFG funded project which explores how social identification with sports groups predicts gambling behaviour. Her previous work with the lab has focused on [metacognition](http://themindlab.uk/posters/metacog_poster.pdf) and [accent perception](http://themindlab.uk/posters/accent_poster.pdf).
