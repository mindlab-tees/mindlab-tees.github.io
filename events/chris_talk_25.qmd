## Abstract

Previous research has indicated that social relationships are a strong factor in the maintenance of gambling harms. There are certain sports (e.g., football), wherein gambling has become a normalised part of socialising within these groups. However, while some research has found sports participation is a predictor of gambling behaviour, there is a lack of work exploring how social identification with sports groups might predict gambling and which aspects of gambling it might be linked to (e.g., frequency of gambling, amount gambled, attitudes to gambling). Furthermore, while we know little about how socialisation can lead to gambling in families, we know little about how people experience the normalisation of gambling within wider social groups. : The aims of this project are: to explore how social identification with sports groups is linked to gambling behaviour; to explore which aspects of gambling behaviour are predicted by social identification with sports groups; to explore how people experience the normalisation of gambling within sports social groups; and to synthesise our findings into recommendations for relevant stakeholders, to support their approaches gambling harm reduction.
