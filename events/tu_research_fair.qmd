This event is part of the Teesside University Research Fair, showcasing research and impact in creative ways and explore research happening at Teesside and with our collaborators and communities.

We will be presenting posters from several currently active research projects, including collaborations with the University of Waterloo (Canada) and work funded by the Academic Forum for the Study of Gambling (AFSG).


Posters will be displayed in the Hub exhibition space, and we will be available to discuss our work and answer any questions you may have. We look forward to seeing you there!

(Posters will be added here after the event.)
