Previous research has demonstrated the relationship between hypomanic states and risky economic behaviour, such as gambling. This study (completed and currently being written for publication) examined this relationship in a sub-clinical population.

The experiment tested competing theories ("goal focus" versus "risk insensitivity") which could explain this phenomenon. Using the Cambridge Gambling Task, we were able to derive distinct patterns of decision-making under risk and relate them to each potential theoretical explanation.
