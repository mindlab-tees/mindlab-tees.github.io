## Research Overview

This work seeks to understand the social, cognitive and neurological factors that contribute to gambling behaviour. 
We are interested in how social identity might moderate the relationship between sports engagement and risk-gambling, the formation of implicit associations between sports and gambling, and the neurological mechanisms underlying these processes.

In addition, we are examining the link between mental health and gambling behaviour, including links with depression, anxiety, and hypomania.

## Projects

 **“It’s part of the sport”: Exploring how social identification with sports groups predicts gambling behaviour and how people experience the normalisation of gambling with sports groups.**

This project received funding from the Academic Forum for the Study of Gambling (AFSG) in April 2025. A link to the project site will be added here when available. The project is led by Dr. Christopher Wilson and Co-investigators Dr. Srdan Medimorec, Dr. Robert Portman, Dr. Judith Eberhardt. Hannah Poulter (Bristol) is also collaborating on this project.
