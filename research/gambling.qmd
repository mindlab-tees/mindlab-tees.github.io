This research programme takes a multi-dimensional approach to understanding and reducing gambling-related harm. 

- Cognitive Moderators (e.g., attention, memory, numeracy)

- Clinical Vulnerability (e.g., depression, hypomania, anxiety)

- The Social Context (e.g., sports engagement, social identity)

- Neurological Correlates (Using fNIRS to map the "in-the-moment" brain activity of decision-making and risk-taking)
