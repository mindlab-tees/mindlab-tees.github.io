The TU Research Fair took place on June 24th, 2025, at the Hub exhibition space in the SU Building. The MIND Lab showcased posters from several currently active research projects, including collaborations with the University of Waterloo (Canada) and work funded by the Academic Forum for the Study of Gambling (AFSG).

Dr. Srdan Medimoric said of the event:

>"We engaged with attendees, discussing our work and answering questions about our research. The event provided an excellent opportunity to share our findings and connect with the broader research community at Teesside University."
